                  to build energy?"
   ↓
[Pro AI] + [Genre Database] + [Music Theory] + [Spotify]
   ↓
Response:
"To build energy from 130 BPM techno, I recommend moving to 133-135 BPM.
 Based on techno's typical energy progression, look for tracks in compatible
 keys (if you're in Am, try Em or Dm). Here are some options from Spotify..."

Suggested Actions:
- Search Spotify for "135 BPM techno"
- Filter by energy > 8
- Use tracks in Em or Dm for harmonic mixing
```

**What makes it powerful:**
- Understands context (genre, BPM, energy goal)
- Combines genre knowledge + music theory + real data
- Conversational and actionable
- Can trigger other AI flows

---

#### 5. **AI Transition Generator** → Choreographed Mixing
```
User: Create smooth transition: Track A → Track B
   ↓
[Pro AI] + [Music Theory] + [Genre Knowledge]
   ↓
Output: "Harmonic Filter Rise" (32 bars, Medium difficulty)

Timeline:
Bar 0:  [Deck A] Playing at 130 BPM in Am
Bar 8:  [Deck B] Start Track B at 128 BPM, sync to 130, volume 0%
Bar 12: [Deck B] Bring volume to 30%, EQ: Low=0, Mid=50%, High=80%
Bar 16: [Deck A] Apply high-pass filter, slowly opening
Bar 20: [Deck A] Bass -6dB, [Deck B] Bass +3dB (bass swap begins)
Bar 24: [Both] Crossfader 50/50, full harmonic blend
Bar 28: [Deck A] Volume fade out, filter fully open
Bar 32: [Deck B] Full control, remove filters

Key Moments: Bar 16 (filter sweep), Bar 24 (harmonic peak)
Pro Tip: Watch waveforms for phrase alignment at bar 16
```

**What makes it powerful:**
- Creates professional choreography
- Uses music theory to ensure harmonic transitions
- Genre-specific techniques (techno = long blends)
- Executable step-by-step instructions

- "1-bar Vocal Stutter" at 3:15 - Creative effect, quick chops

Performance Tips:
- Use cue #2 to jump to drums-only for quick blends
- Loop the breakdown (cue #5) to extend energy build
- Cue #7 vocal hit works great with echo effect
```

**What makes it powerful:**
- Genre knowledge informs cue placement (techno = long intros)
- Color system for visual organization
- Performance-specific advice
- Ready for immediate use
